      To wire the Claude Code hooks and start the daemon at login, run:
        #{share}/clawdex/install.sh

      Then:
        clawdex list
        clawdex wake

      Pets are read from ~/.codex/pets/ and ~/.clawdex/pets/.
      Existing Codex pets work unmodified.

  # launchd agent (so source-from-clone users and brew-installed users get the
  # same on-disk plist instead of fighting over a shared socket).
